  abstract = {We investigate the state complexity of some operations on binary regular languages. In particular, we consider the concatenation of languages represented by deterministic finite automata, and the reversal and complementation of languages represented by nondeterministic finite automata. We prove that the upper bounds on the state complexity of these operations, which were known to be tight for larger alphabets, are tight also for binary alphabets.}
