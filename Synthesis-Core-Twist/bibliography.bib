  abstract = {
    We investigate the descriptional complexity of operations on finite and
    infinite regular languages over unary and arbitrary alphabets. The
    languages are represented by nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). In
    particular, we consider Boolean operations, catenation operations –
    concatenation, iteration, λ-free iteration – and the reversal. Most of the
    shown bounds are tight in the exact number of states, i.e. the number is
    sufficient and necessary in the worst case. Otherwise tight bounds in the
    order of magnitude are shown.
